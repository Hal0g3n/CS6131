    "Chess has been gaining popularity since the start of the pandemic. With the game of chess becoming more mainstream, someone needs to provide the service of playing chess online. A chess website is one of the ways of providing such services, with several purposes such as:\n",
    "- **Online play**: Chess websites provide an easy and convenient way for people to play chess against other players from around the world.\n",
    "- **Learning and Improvement**: Chess websites offer resources such as puzzles, and tactics trainers to help users improve their skills.\n",
    "- **Community**: Chess websites provide a community for chess players to interact and connect with others who share their interest in the game.\n",
    "- **Competition**: Chess websites offer organized tournaments and events for players to compete against each other and test their skills.\n",
    "- **Accessibility**: Chess websites make the game of chess accessible to people who may not have easy access to physical chess sets or opponents.\n",
    "\n",
    "When making a chess website with the above purposes, there is a lot of data to store. Tournament information, Player information, Player history, Played Games, Puzzles, Tactics. These are all data that the website must handle. All these information are related to one another, like which players are playing a chess game and which players are participating in the tournament. With a Relational DataBase Management System (RDBMS), the data and all its relationships can be maintained and managed easily and efficiently, allowing for a smooth experience when playing chess online."
